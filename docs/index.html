<h1>Sample Treasure Hunt Web App</h1>
<div>
    This is a sample project for CO1111's assignment, aka the Treasure Hunt app.
    It describes the minimum content you need to have in your app.
</div>
<div>
    Make sure your index page has a link to your treasure hunt web app like this:<br>
    <button onclick="location.href='app.html';">Find the Treasure Hunt!</button>
</div>
<div>
    As this is the 'index' page, it will be the landing point for everyone visiting your team's page.
</div>
<div>
    Note some important requirements:
    <ul>
        <li>This is the landing page, i.e. the starting point of your website.</li>
        <li>The main purpose of this landing page is to <i>market</i> your app. So use what you have learned in class to explain your advantages (make it worth-while for your visitors).</li>
        <li>Also make sure it looks good and explains clearly the purpose of this page.</li>
        <li>The recommendation is to keep all your marketing/video/info details in a single page but it's ok if you decide to split that to multiple pages.</li>
        <li>Aim at using the best practice approaches, splitting the content (HTML) and design properties (CSS) to separate files.</li>
        <li>Your page and app should follow the 'mobile-first' design paradigm, meaning it should certainly be functional and appropriate for mobile devices. But also test it on desktop screens.</li>
        <li>You are encouraged to <i>avoid</i> using any of the styling frameworks (such as Bootstrap, Material etc.). I know they are good, but it's better if you try try to build your own web-app from scratch, so you get the necessary experience.</li>
        <li>There is also a requirement to specify a <a href="test.html">test.html</a> page that includes your testing scripts.</li>
        <li>Please note <b>this</b> GitHub project is only a recommendation. You are not required to clone it or use it as the starting point (but feel free to do so if you wish). Your definite guide is the assignment handout itself (available on Blackboard).</li>
        <li>Hint: It's a good idea to make it easy for the markers to view and mark your submission.</li>
    </ul>
